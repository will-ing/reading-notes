# Hash Tables

1. A `hash` is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
2. A `bucket` is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
3. A `collision` is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
