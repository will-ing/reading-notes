# Linear Regression

`Linear regression` is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques.

`Regression` searches for relationships among variables.

`Scikit-learn` is a powerful Python module for machine learning.

First import libraries into ipynb -

```py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn
```

> you can do train-test split by dividing your data sets randomly. Scikit learn provides a function called train_test_split to do this.

Residual plots are a good way to visualize the errors in your data.
