# React

* JSX -  it is a syntax extension to JavaScript, JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
* React elements are `immutable`.
* An element is like a single frame in a movie
* It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.
* `Components` are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
* When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object `props`.
* In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.
* Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements
