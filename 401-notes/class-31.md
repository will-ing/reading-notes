# Django REST

## Docker

`Docker` is a way to isolate and run entire applications. You can use any OS when using docker.

The downside to Docker is its complexity under the hood.


> Docker Compose is an additional tool that is automatically included with Mac and Windows downloads of Docker

For Linux you can use:

1. `sudo pip install docker-compose`
2. `docker run hello-world`

- An `image` is a snapshot in time of what a project contains
- A `container` is a running instance of the image.

`Image layering ` exists for two main reasons. First, each image layer is immutable–unchanged–like a git commit. The second reason is performance.

The order in a Dockerfile matters a lot.
