# React 2

* Conditional Rendering - ike if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
* You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.
* Usually you would render lists inside a component.
* orm elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. 
* In React, a <textarea> uses a value attribute instead.
* Components donâ€™t know their children ahead of time
