# Graphs

## Two types of graphs

* `Undirected Graph` is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
* `Directed Graph` also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
* `complete graph` is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
* `connected graph` is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
* `disconnected graph` is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
* `acyclic graph` is a directed graph without cycles.
* `cycle` is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
* `Adjacency matrix` is represented through a 2-dimensional array.
* `weighted graph` is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called `weights`.
