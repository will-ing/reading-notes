# Cryptography

`Cryptography` - the art and science of encrypting sensitive information, was once exclusive to the realms of government, academia, and the military.

Requires `encryption` and `decryption`

`Polymorphism` is basically a cipher that changes itself with each use.

## Types of cryptography

1. Hashing - type of cryptography that changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the messageâ€™s contents, not hiding the message itself.
2. Symmetric Cryptography - uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery.
3. Asymmetric Cryptography - uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography.
4. Key Exchange Algorithms - is used to safely exchange encryption keys with an unknown party.

## The 4 Types of Cryptographic Functions

1. Authentication
2. Nonrepudiation
3. Confidentiality
4. Integrity
