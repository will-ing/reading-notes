Regex in python is imported with re

```py
import re
```

- The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None
- raw string literal - `r'Cookie'`
- `search function`, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.
- `group function`returns the string matched by the re. You will see both these functions in more detail later.
- `.` - A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
- `^` - A caret. Matches the start of the string.
- `$` - Matches the end of string.
