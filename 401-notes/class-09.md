## Probability

`probability` - seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest.

These two events form the **sample space**, the set of all possible events that can happen.

The `normal distribution` refers to a particularly important phenomenon in the realm of probability and statistics.

The most important qualities to notice about the `normal distribution` is its symmetry and its shape.
